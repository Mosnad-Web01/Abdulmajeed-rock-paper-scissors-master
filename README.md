### What I learned

How loop through an array from the first to last element and back to the first continuosly, using the modulus(remainder) operator '%' and setInterval


```js
let x = 0;

setInterval(() => {
    let y = x % boxShadow.length;
    $(element).css('boxShadow', boxShadow[y]);
    x++;
}, 500);
```

### Continued development

make the buttons react when you click on them, and adding of sound to the game to make iy more interesting
